Use scss instead of css.
--------------------------
Use only actions and listeners:
https://github.com/.../react.../tree/main/client/src/store;
Have an initial static json file for all your vars:
https://github.com/.../client/src/store/initial.state.json
Have a path folder for your paths:
https://github.com/.../react.../tree/main/client/src/paths
Create your components inside of the component folder:
https://github.com/.../tree/main/client/src/components
Use and add your own "Tools":
https://github.com/.../react.../tree/main/client/src/tools
Comes with a server, after building the client with "npm run-script build", type "npm run-script start" and see your results from the main directory:
https://github.com/.../react-express.../tree/main/server
The client can be developed in real-time, 
type "npm run-script start" in the client folder. 
Add nodemon using "npm install nodemon" in the main folder to server for real time changes while developing the server side.
Use "npm run-script startmon" after adding it to the package.json section called: "scripts" inside of the main folder.
-------------------------------|(FIREBASE)|------------------------------
Connect the initial.static.json file to firebase for save-state:
https://github.com/.../main/client/src/store/reducers.js
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Server is firebase ready ðŸ˜‰. Connect-IT! (See, YouTube.tutorial)
===========================================
Use the same logic for native "smartphone" applications!
